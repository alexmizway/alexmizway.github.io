#  CS-499 ePortfolio
#### Hello! I am Alex Mizway and this is my ePortfolio for CS-499 at SNHU.
## Professional Self-Assessment
#### Having been in this program at SNHU for over 6 years, I have developed, worked, and honed several computer science skills such as the ability to collaborate, communicating to shareholders, programming techniques and several more. I would like to first focus on the skill of communicating with shareholders and collaboration. I was able to best demonstrate this when I played the role of a Scrum Leader and had to both lead the Scrum team through the development cycle and also had to interact with the shareholders. This role was crucial in developing these skills as having the ability to both explain the technical terms in a easy-to-understand way as well as managing the Scrum team is necessary for team projects where shareholders are interested in keeping tabs on the project. This demonstrates the ability to employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science. When it comes to programming skills, I have practiced and utilized intentful comments, keeping a security mindset and having the ability to work with several languages. While my current career choices are moving towards library science to potentially become a librarian, I still plan on continuing my efforts into mantaining programming skills, data structures, databases, and security skills as there are still paths involving both the computer science and library science
#### Summarize/introduce how your artifacts fit together and inform the portfolio as a whole; this will help demonstrate the full range of your computer science talents and abilities? This section should introduce your audience to the technical artifacts that will follow the professional self-assessment.
